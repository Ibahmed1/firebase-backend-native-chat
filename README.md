# firebase-backend-native-chat

## Overview

This is a personal project of mine built to learn how React Native and Firebase work. This is a messaging app which users must sign up and log in using email, they can then add friends via email address and then send and receive messages from their friends.

This is the backend of the app which deals with all queries to the firebase cloud firestore database.
